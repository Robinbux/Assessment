# 42 Fillit

My assesment for the Fillit challenge of 42, Silicon Valley.
This challenge was haded to us, by the CODE University of applied sciences, Berlin.

The task was to create a program, that takes a text file containing tetris pieces like this:

```
....
##..
.#..
.#..

....
####
....
....

#...
###.
....
....

....
##..
.##.
....
```

After that, it should arrange them into the smalles sqqare possible, for example in this case:

**
DDAA
CDDA
CCCA
BBBB
**

Usage: ./fillit [file]
